<!-- Conclusions -->
<h2 id="conclusions"> :scroll: Conclusions</h2>

1. The majority of bookings are for hotels in cities.
2. In comparison to city hotels, resort hotels have less cancellations.
3. The aviation industry has the shortest waiting list time.
4. The number of days on the waiting list is larger for TA -> Travel Agent and TO -> Travel Operator bookings.
5. The months of August, July, and May saw the most bookings for city hotels.
6. In addition, the number of bookings at the Resort hotel increased in August.
7. When a consumer is repeated, the lowest cancellation rate occurs.
8. The lead time for the month of July is quite long, while the lead time for the months of January and February is extremely short.
9. The average daily rate for Resort Hotels is higher in July, August, and September.
10. The average daily rate for City Hotels is higher in June, July, and May.
11. The vast majority of reservations are for hotels in cities. Resort hotels have fewer cancellations than city hotels. The aviation industry has the shortest wait time.

13. The months of August, July, and May saw the most hotel bookings in the city. The lowest cancellation rate occurs when a consumer is repeated. The lead time for July is quite long, whereas the lead time for January and February is extremely short. In July, August, and September, the average daily rate for Resort Hotels is higher.

15. In June, July, and May, the average daily rate for City Hotels is higher. Customers travelling with children have little preference for the type of hotel they stay in. In both cases, the number of stays with and without children is rather equal. Customers who stayed for 1-7 days with or without children had the same count.

17. If we take the average stay, three to four days will be spent with youngsters, while the rest of the time will be spent with adults solely.

19. Online TA customer group has the highest number of hotel reservations in the city and at resort hotels. As a result, the impact of room type allocation on clients is minimal. The majority of appointments are made by consumers of the Online TA group who book directly through the website.
